to use this you have to install by clone this to your pc      
**DO NOT DOWNLOAD ZIP**  

```
git clone https://github.com/milkiezi/Final-project.git
```
go to flask-project and install requirement.txt then start python

```
cd flask-project
pip install -r requirement.txt
py app.py //Or run with Flask
```
after that open new terminal
go to client and install requirement.txt then start python

```
cd client
pip install -r requirement.txt
py app.py //Or run with Flask
```
also you need to use flask and pip to run this so you should install them before you run anything
